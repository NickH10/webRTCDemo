# webRTCDemo

This is a very simple webRTC chat demo that will allow two people to create a video chat connection. Currently only supported in Chrome and Firefox.

# Installation

Download repo, set up a simple server, go to the server url. If it's not a secure server you will have to give video permissions every time. Otherwise it will remember your first choice.

# In Progress

Keep in mind this isn't fully functional yet, still a work in progress
